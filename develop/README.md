# PISCppLibrary
Our goal is to develop a comprehensive C++ template library that complements the Standard Template Library (STL). We aim to:
- **Optimize for Memory Performance**: Focus on efficient memory usage to improve overall performance, especially in resource-constrained environments.  
- **Ensure Security and Robustness**: Implement secure coding practices to protect against common vulnerabilities and ensure that our templates are reliable under various conditions.
- **Achieve Full STL Compatibility**: Ensure our templates integrate seamlessly with the STL, allowing for easy and consistent use within existing C++ projects.
- **Adhere to C++ Conventions**: Follow widely accepted C++ coding standards and conventions to make our library intuitive and easy to use for developers familiar with the language.
We welcome contributions and suggestions. If you're interested in helping us refine this library, your input would be greatly appreciated.
